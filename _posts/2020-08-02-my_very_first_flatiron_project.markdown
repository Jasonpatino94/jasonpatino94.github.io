**Puppy breed info API

The very first project I completed for Flatiron was a CLI that used API(s) to pull information from a website to help with information needed to complete the project. The very first problem I was trying to pick out a topic to actually wanted to do it on. The next problem I had was when I actually chose what I wanted to do it on, halfway into the project I realized I needed an API-Key which I wouldnt have been able to get for a week or so, at this point I had to choose another topic. Eventually my project ended up being about dog breeds and information about them.

What my CLI project does:
1. Choose to either look up the list of dog breeds or exit the program
2. If you choose to look at the dog breeds, it gives you a list of all the breeds and you get to select which breed you want to know more about
3. You dont have to spell out the name correctly, as long as you have some letters, it will return a list of dogs that matches those letters and information on all of them
4. The program then goes back to the beginning if you want to know about other breeds you go through the same process or end the program at that point.

I had a fun time getting the project to work. It was frustrating at first, especially since i had already done half of the project until i realized i needed a key to make the rest of the project work, thus having to start all over with a new topic. However after i chose a new topic, since i had already got so far, it was just extra practice to get to the point where i was. I think the hardest part was knowing where to start during this project, but once you get started its basically a straight line from there

Some things that really helped me get through this project was writing down notes about what exactly i wanted the program to do step by step, and everytime i got stuck on a spot i would ask for help. I also would try and take it step by step instead of trying to do everything all at once, that way you dont confuse yourself and skip a crutial step.
