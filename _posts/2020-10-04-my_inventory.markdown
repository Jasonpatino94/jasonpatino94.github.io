### The Sinatra Project

This project was a stressful yet very fun project for me. I learned how to use Sinatra to edit my code and put everything in the browser and it is just awesome! I knew immediately what i wanted this project! An app that kept track of all motorized vehicles you may own!. This is because i have so many vehicles and go through so many that sometimes its hard to keep track of them, So why not make an app that saves them for you!

So how does it work? 
1. When you start up the app, you will start at the "welcome" page where you will choose to either sign in (if you have an account) or sign up (if you dont have one)
2. One you have signed up and signed in, you will be redirected into you inventories page where you will be able to see all your inventories. at this point you will add or click on an exsisting inventory to see more about it.
3. When you click on an exsisting inventory, you will be able to edit or delete this by clicking the edit or delete button.
4. If youre doing using the app, you can always sign out, and sign back in at a later time to edit or add more inventories.

This was such a fun project because it was something i really wanted to make an app for AND i had a great time communicating with my classmates and helping them out while they helped me out with mine. Im still not a pro at HTML and CSS but they helped me out a TON during this project and i actually learned so much while doing this project.

Some things that helped me get through this app was making a checklist. When i tell you that it is very easy to get lost while making a but of folders and files, IM DEFINITELY SERIOUS! Another HUGE help was my classmates, some of the stuff i honestly would have never have guessed if it wasnt for them! Whenever i finished one part of the project i tried to go on the browser and make sure it worked exactly how i wanted it to work. Also i tried my best to always push my app onto git hub whenever i remembered!
