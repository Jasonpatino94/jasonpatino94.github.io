When I first started Ruby on Rails I figured it was going to be the same as the sinatra project. I wasn't totally wrong, but there was definitely some new material that really confused me. For example nested resources and nested routes, I couldn't figure out how both of them worked for the longest time! Thanks to my teacher (Chett) and my fellow classmates, I eventually figured out how they worked.

In the rails project I ended up making vehicle dealership app where :
1) A dealership can enter their information at anytime, whether a customer/user is logged in or not, and add all their vehicles to their inventory. 
2) A user/customer and log in and look at their inventory or choose to browse vehicles by dealership, or browse all the vehicles that exist.
3)  Once a user/customer finds a vehicle that they like or want, they can click the purchase button which will automatically put the vehicle in the customers inventory.
4)  A customer can edit or delete their vehicle and once they are done doing anything they want while they are logged in, they can log out and another user can now log in.

My experience with the project was just absolutely amazing. I ended up starting this project thinking I didnt understand anything and thinking that I was going to fail, to actually completing my project and helping out with many others project. There was a part where I was confused about the flash messages, but one of my classmates helped me out with that and it was quickly resolved.

I am excited to continue learning to code more and learning javascript next. Sometimes I just cant believe how much I have learned and grown throughout this course and I can't wait to learn more!
