After working in the auto industry for 6+ years and being laid off due to the pandemic, I decided that it was time for a change. I was bored with the same routine I had in my current career and I wanted to learn something new. My brother introduced me to software engineering as he was pursuing his degree at Rutgers University. We worked on a computer science course uploaded online by Harvard and I genuinely found myself continuously engaged. Through these experiences and self refelction, I found myself with the need to learn more. Therefore, I decided to enroll in a software engineering bootcamp with Flatiron School.
