After working in the auto industry for 6+ years i figured that maybe it was time for a change. I was getting bored with the same routine and the 50+ hour work weeks every day. I decided to maybe learn something new. My brother actually introduced me to software engineering and i would tag along when he had a javascript class in school, Software development just seems really cool and fun.

I decided to learn software development because i love solving puzzles. I want to create new apps or make websites that everyone can use. I love learning new skills and I decided to try a cs50 course from harvard and i immediately fell in love with it and wanted to learn more. I went online and did more research on schools that teach it and i really liked Flatirons schedule and sylabus. I really want to do more with my life and i feel like learning this will not only help me learn a new skill but progress in life, Just figuring out these labs makes me feel like im progressing so much.
