When my cohort at Flatiron proceeded with the curriculum, I was extremely excited to start the last part of this course, React! The beginning didn’t seem that difficult at all. I picked up components, state, hooks, etc pretty quick. Towards the middle of the course is where things started to take a turn for me.

The lifecycle methods were extremely confusing and took me quite a bit of time to understand the concept of them. For example “componentDidMount” is invoked after updating happens, and componentWillUnmount is invoked right before a component is unmounted. There are tons of lifecycle methods that really confused me at first, but eventually I got the hang of them!

All in all I feel like React definitely made Javascript easier and cleaner to work with since you have a bunch of components that you can add into other components so the code is more spread out and easier to read. I really enjoyed working with React and the last part that I had to learn was Redux!
