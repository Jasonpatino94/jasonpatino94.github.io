For my final project, I decided to get away from cars and switch it to another subject that is very important in my life, a workout app. Being a volunteer firefighter, I train every other day at the firehouse to stay in shape to make sure I am ready to go into a fire. Another way of making sure I'm ready is by working out and making sure I have the strength to do it.

In this app you create your account and log in every single workout you do. It records how much weight you lifted, how many reps you did it for and how many total sets you did. I chose to do this project using both class components and functional components so that I had a good feel and understanding of both. I also decided to separate both using stateless and stateful components.

The most difficult part of this app in my opinion, was how i wanted to lay it out. Once i had figured that out, the rest wasn’t too bad. I had a lot of fun making this project and separating everything into components really made it nice and organized. For my first app using React and Redux, i really enjoyed it and had a lot of fun! I can’t wait to keep moving forward with my new knowledge on software engineering and I'm excited for what the future has in store for me!
