## My first Javascript project

When i first started Javascript (JS), i thought i was going to get the hang of it pretty quick. As the days went by and i was learning how to do more with JS, it got difficult really quick. I had to put plenty of hours every day to just keep up with everything. In my opinion, JS was more difficult to learn than ruby, but eventually i got to figure out how it works.

For my JS project i ended up making a hangman game! In the game you get to:
1. Guess a word and you have a maximum of 10 guesses until you lose
2. Once you correctly guess the word, you can enter your name and submit it so that your name and score is listed in the scoreboard
3. You can click on "Word List" to get all the words in the game and you can also create a word in the pop up screen (modal)
4. you can also click on the "View all Scores" button to get a list of all the scores that were submitted in the game.

Throughout the project i encountered many problems that were very difficult to figure out. With the help of my instuctor and the cohort i was able to figure them all out. My main problem was submitting my project to GitHub. Which i was able to figure out myself. I was able to see other peoples project and that helped me out with mine and what i was missing. 

I am excited to move foward with the cohort and start the next part which is react! I've learned so much throughout this course and i am definitely excited to move forward!
